## What is in the PDB databse

The main repository of biomolecular strcture info is in the PDB < www.rcsb.org > 

Let's see what this database contains: 


```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats


```

We have to get rid of the commas in the data so it can be read as numeric instead of characters.
- we can use the `sub()` function which is a type of "find and replace" function

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",", "", x))) 
```

Now we need to turn this into a function so it can be used for the other columns of data using `apply()`
```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(sub(",", "", x)))
}
  
sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
  
```

Applying the function to each column for the whole table (the two indicates column)
```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```
These are the percentages of structures solved by each method. 
```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)/n.total
#applying the sumcomma function to each column in the table, and then dividing by the total, stored in the variable n.total
```



> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
n.protein <- sumcomma(stats[1,"Total"])
n.protein
```

```{r}
n.protein/n.total
```


## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* viewer is now everywhere. The homepage is  https://molstar.org/viewer/ . 

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```


## Predicting functional motions of a single strcture

We can do bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (flexibility/dynamics): 

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

nma is normal mode analysis
```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```
Saving a pdb file to the directory - we can open this in Mol*
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```



## Comparative Analysis of Protein Strutures

Here we will work through a complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of structur, dynamics, and function. 


```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
id <- "1ake_a"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```


```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```


```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Alignment Printout 
```{r}
pdbs
```



```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```


```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
#take the output of the pca and creating a new file that can be opened in Mol*
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
