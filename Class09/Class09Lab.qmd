In today's class we will examine some data about candy from the 538 website. 


## Import Data
```{r}
candy_file <- "BIMM143Candy-data.txt"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```


## Data Exploration - your favorite candy 
> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```
There are 85 types of candy in the dataset. 


> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

There are 38 fruity candy types in the dataset. 


> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy", ]$winpercent
```
My favorite candy is Almond Joy, which has a winpercent value of 50.35. 


> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```



> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```



```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```



> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The variables sugar percent, winpercent, and price percent are on a different scale than the majority of the other columns in the dataset. These three variables do not exclusively use 0 or 1 values. 


> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

A zero likely represent no chocolate being present in the candy, a one represents that chocolate is present in the candy. 



> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=7)
```

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical, it is slightly skewed left. 

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution (the median) is slightly below 50, but the mean is 50.32. 


> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
#the average winpercent for chocolate containing candy
choc.winpercent <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
mean(choc.winpercent)

#the average winpercent for fruit containing candy
fruit.winpercent <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
mean(fruit.winpercent)


```
On average, chocolate candy is ranked higher than fruit candy; the average winpercent is 60.9, for fruit it is 44.1


```{r}
# A different way to write the same code as above: 
chocolate.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
chocolate.win <- candy[chocolate.inds,]$winpercent
mean(chocolate.win)

fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.win <- candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```


> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.winpercent, fruit.winpercent)
```
The difference is statistically significant, the p-value from the t-test is less than 0.05. 



## Data Exploration - Overall Candy Rankings 

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

The order function returns the indices that make the input sorted. 

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```
The five least liked candy types in the dataset are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters. 


> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

The top 5 most liked candy types in this data set are Reese's Peanut Butter cups, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers.  

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) + 
  geom_col()
```


> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) + 
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggsave("BIMM143Lab09barplot.png", height = 10)
```

![Exported image that is a bit bigger so it is legible](BIMM143Lab09barplot.png)

Time to add color: 

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```


```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```



> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst rated chocolate candy is Sixlets. 


> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked fruity candy is Starburst. 



## Data Analysis - Looking at Pricepercent


```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)

```
Higher pricepercent values are more expensive, higher winpercent values indicate higher ranking. 

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

The candy with the highest ranking but a lower price is Reese's Miniatures. 

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```
The top five most expensive candies are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring pop, Hershey's Krackel, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate. 



## Exploring the Correlation Structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

The anti-correlated values are chocolate and fruity. 

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Aside from correlations with themselves, the variables of chocolate and winpercent are the most positively correlated. 


## Principal Component Analysis

We need to scale the data, not all the variables have data of the same scale!
```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
#If scale = FALSE (which is the default, the PCA analysis will be dominated by winpercent since it is measured on a different scale in comparison to the other variables.)
```



```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
# here we are selecting for columns 1 and 2; which are PC1 and PC2

```


To add color: 

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```


To use ggplot for PCA we have to have a dataframe input, so we need to turn out PCA data into a dataframe. 

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```


```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")

```


```{r}

#library(plotly)
# ggplotly allows you to see labels when you hover over a data point
#ggplotly(p)
```



How do the original variables contribute to our PCs? We need to look at the loadings component of our results object `pca$rotation`

Make a barplot with ggplot and order the bars by their value. Recall that you need a data.fram as the input for a ggplot. 

```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(res)+ 
  aes(PC1, reorder(row.names(res), PC1)) + 
  geom_col()
```



```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```


> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus were picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. This makes sense as these variables are expected to be correlated, it is common for fruity candy to be sold in bags/boxes of multiples; it is also more common for fruity candy to be hard when compared to chocolate.
